# AKSHAT'S PORTFOLIO
This is the portfolio site made by Akshat Sharma.

## BRIEF INTRODUCTION
Hello, My name is Akshat Sharma and I am from India.
Currently I am a Software Developer at Applicate AI.
I am in my last year of undergraduation persuing from KIET Group of Institutions,
Majoring in Computer Science.


## PROJECT PURPOSE

I created this portfolio to showcase my projects and work to the community.
To present myself as a potential candidate for the opportunity.

### TECHNOLOGY USED

REACT JS - I have used React JS as a front end framework for this project. As react is one of the most popular framework today and also because, as this is a very lightweight application without any backend so react would be perfect for it.

REACT-ICONS - They fits perfectly with react so no second thought.

FRAMER-MOTION - It is one of the best animation library out there which I have used.

SCSS - Insted of plain css I prefer SCSS mainly because of its ease to write nested selectors that is much more easier to understand.

REACT-TOOLTIP - A lightweight and easy dependency to be included as compared to create custom tooltip with css.

SANITY CMS - To be hones I never knew about this CMS untill I watched Javascript Master's viedo and after that I could not resist to use it.

### ASSETS
The assets that are include are mainly created by me and some of the template are taken from - https://www.freepik.com/
I Used Illustrator and Photoshop to edit and create new assets.
